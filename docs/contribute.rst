*****************

First of all thanks for your interest in contributing in this project.

We used black_ and pylint_ to format and lint the code. GitHub actions are run on the merge request to check that the code is valid.

You can directly install the dev dependencies with `poetry install --with dev`

The tests of SVG2TikZ are written using the unittest package. You can run all the test with command `python -m unittest`.
